php-login-minimal
=================

A simple, but secure PHP login script. All the basic functions in a clean file structure, uses MySQL and mysqli.
Register, login, logout.

This is the 1-minimal version of the https://github.com/panique/php-login project. The php-login project currently
gets a massive makeover, all versions get their own repos. What you see is in-development.
